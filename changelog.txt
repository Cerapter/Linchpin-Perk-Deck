Version 1.1:
- Removed Eyes Open!.
- Eyes Open! replaced by Conserve Ammo!, which gives an ammo box pickup boost.
- Fixed an oversight where I added a max amount of stacks then never used them, allowing potentially 13 * 8 stacks from a full team with 2 jokers each. You now correctly only get 4 * 8 stacks, with an additional 8 from the last card, and a "theoretical" additional 8 from In Sync (see below).
- In Sync changed to give the "treat as if you had 8 more Cohesion" effect instead of the crew dodge metre fill effect it had.
- Lead By Example! changed to speed up both gain and loss rate.
- Hold The Line! changed to slow down both gain and loss rate.
- A third choice was added for In Sync that does not adjust gain and loss rates.
- Quick Steps renamed to Speed Is Key, and effect changed to bagging corpses and interacting with hostages faster.
- Keep Moving! and Shoot and Scoot! both had their bonus changed from +5% per 8 stack to +2% per 8 stack.
- Every Angle Covered got Quick Steps's old dodge boost.
- Dig In Your Heels! grants an additional 0.25 HP per 8 stacks now instead of 1 HP.
- Stand Firm! now grants 2% armour regen per 8 stack, and its dodge metre fill is replaced by granting 4 armour per 8 stack.
- Keep Pressing On! now grants 2% faster stamina regen per 8 stack. Its other benefit was simply rephrased, but otherwise has the same effect.

Version 1.0:
- First public release!
